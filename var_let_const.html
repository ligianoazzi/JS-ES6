			<li>The difference between var and let envolves the scope, var can cause scope leak. Inside if, while, for</li>
			<li>Another point is related to performance, the variable will take longer to be destroyed.</li>

			<li>This is the sequence you need try to create: 1 - const, 2 - leet, 3 - var</li>
